# Dependency Inversion Principle

This is the 'D' in SOLID. It stands for Dependency Inversion Principle, often abbreviated as DIP.  

It states, 
- *"High Level Modules should not depend on Low Level Modules. Both should depend on abstractions"*
- *"Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions"*.

So there are 2 parts to this principle. But the fundamental concept behind both parts is the same, one follows from the other.
